  "description": "The Phalanx are a cybernetic species in Marvel comics universe. They have come in conflict with the X-Men and related groups on several occasions. They form a hive-mind, linking each member by a telepathy-like system. The Phalanx were created by writer Scott Lobdell and given definitive design by artist Joe Madureira.  They owe much in concept and appearance to the original Technarchy (by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bill Sienkiewicz).  Although appearing in prototype  variations in earlier issues, the Phalanx first appeared in their full form in Uncanny X-Men #312 (May 1994).",
