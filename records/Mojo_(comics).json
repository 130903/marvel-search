  "description": "Mojo is a fictional character, a super villain appearing in books published by Marvel Comics, usually those featuring the X-Men family of characters. Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams, Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), as the titular hero's archvillain. When Longshot later joined the superteam the X-Men, Mojo became a recurring villain to those characters as well.Mojo is one of the \"Spineless Ones,\" an alien race that is immobile without advanced technology. He is a slaver who rules the Mojoverse, a dimension where all beings are addicted to his gladiator-like television programs. The character is an absurdist parody of network executives, and was created as a result of the influence of writers like Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky and Walter Lippmann on Nocenti.",
