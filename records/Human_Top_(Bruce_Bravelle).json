  "description": "The Human Top (or just the Top) is a fictional character, a Golden Age superhero appearing in two stories published by Timely Comics (the predecessor of Marvel Comics) in 1940 and 1942, and not since then. His real name is Bruce Bravelle. He is called \"the Human Top\" in the story titles but just \"the Top\" within the body of the stories.He is not to be confused with two other Marvel Comics Human Tops, to whom he bears no relation: Davey Cannon, who first appeared in 1963 under the name Human Top but is better known as Whirlwind, and Kid Commandos/V-Battalion member David Mitchell who first appeared in 1978, also under the name Human Top.",
