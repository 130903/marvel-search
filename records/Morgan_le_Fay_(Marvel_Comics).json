  "description": "Morgan le Fay is a fictional character in Marvel Comics who is loosely based on the Morgan le Fay of Arthurian legend. In this version of the character, she is the half-faerie half-sister of the mythic Arthur. Her elven heritage granted her immortality, and she used this time to master the mystic arts. She occasionally tries to take over the world. She has been an opponent of The Avengers, and in the 1970s, she was the major villain in the original Spider-Woman comic, and was opposed by a reincarnation of her \"ancient foe\" and former lover of Magnus and Doctor Doom. She was a member of the Darkholders for a time.",
