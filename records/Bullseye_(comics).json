  "description": "Bullseye is a fictional character, a supervillain in the Marvel Comics universe. A psychopathic assassin, Bullseye uses the opportunities afforded by his line of work to exercise his homicidal tendencies and to work out his own personal vendetta against Daredevil.Although he possesses no superpowers, Bullseye is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile, be it weapons like shuriken and sai or seemingly harmless objects like playing cards and pencils. His markmanship is uncanny, at a nearly preternatural level, but he has been known to miss moving targets.In the Daredevil live-action film, he is portrayed by actor Colin Farrell.IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Bullseye as #20.",
