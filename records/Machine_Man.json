  "description": "Machine Man (Aaron Stack, serial number Z2P45-9-X-51 or X-51 for short) is a fictional character, an android superhero in the Marvel Comics Universe. The character was created by Jack Kirby for 2001: A Space Odyssey #8 (July 1977), a comic written and drawn by Kirby featuring concepts based on the eponymous Stanley Kubrick film and Arthur C. Clarke novel.  Shortly thereafter, Machine Man spun off into his own Kirby-created series.  He is a robot, the only survivor of a series, raised as a human son of scientist Abel Stack, who was killed removing his auto-destruct mechanism, and further evolved to sentience by a Monolith.",
