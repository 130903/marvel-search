  "description": "Alexander Bont is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe, appearing in the series Daredevil. He was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev, first appearing in Daredevil vol. 2, #66 (Dec. 2004). He was retconned into being the Kingpin of Crime before Wilson Fisk. His story was told via flashbacks, which were drawn to resemble artwork from the Silver Age of comic books. The climax of Daredevil Vol. 2, #65 (Nov. 2004) alluded to Murdock having been Bont's attorney at one time. This plot thread was dropped however as it was revealed in later issues that Matt refused to be his lawyer.",
