  "description": "Romulus is a fictional comic book supervillain appearing in books published by Marvel Comics, in particular those featuring Wolverine. He is the leader of the Lupines, a species resembling humans that evolved from canines instead of primates through convergent evolution. He is a shadowy character whose origin and motives remain a mystery. He is shown to have orchestrated most major events in the life of Wolverine, manipulating and controlling him for most of his life. Created by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Simone Bianchi, the character first appeared obscured by shadow in Wolverine vol. 3 #50 (March 2007), and made his first full appearance in Wolverine: Origins #39 (August 2009).",
