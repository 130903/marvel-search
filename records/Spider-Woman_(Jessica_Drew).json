  "description": "Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew) is a fictional character, a superheroine in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Marvel Spotlight #32 (cover-dated February 1977), and 50 issues of an ongoing series titled Spider-Woman followed. At its conclusion she was killed, and though later resurrected in an Avengers story arc, she fell into disuse, supplanted by other characters using the name Spider-Woman.Writer Brian Michael Bendis added Spider-Woman to the roster of the high profile New Avengers. In 2009, the character received her second self-titled limited series, written by Bendis, which ran for seven issues.  As part of the Spider-Verse event, Spider-Woman will receive her third ongoing series, this time written by Dennis Hopeless.",
