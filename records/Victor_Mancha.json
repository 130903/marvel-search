  "description": "Victor Mancha is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics award-winning series, Runaways. He was created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in Runaways vol. 2 #1 (April 2005).  Like the original runaways, Victor has a supervillain for a parent but he also has a superhero for a grandparent; his father is the robot Ultron and his grandfather is the superhero Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym (aka Ant-Man). Victor's flesh and natural tissue is cloned from his human mother and completely conceals metal parts and circuitry underneath, making him a cyborg.",
