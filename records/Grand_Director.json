  "description": "The Grand Director (William Burnside), also known as the Captain America of the 1950s, is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe. He was created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema in Captain America #153-156 (Septemberâ€“December, 1972) as having been a specifically different Captain America, the Captain America introduced in 1953 in Young Men comics. In a later storyline, the character was given a new white costume and the title \"The Grand Director\" by Buscema and writers Roger McKenzie and Jim Shooter in Captain America #232 (April, 1979) and altered to be a villain, leader of a group of White Supremacists that included a brainwashed Sharon Carter. The character was killed off at the end of that storyline, and not used again until Captain America (Vol. 5) #42, returning to being active as the \"Captain America of the 1950s\" separate from the then-current Captain America, James \"Bucky\" Barnes.",
