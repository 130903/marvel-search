  "description": "Klara Prast (also known as Tower of Flower or Rose Red) is a fictional character that appears in the Marvel Comics Runaways. The character first appeared in volume 2, #27 and was created by writer Joss Whedon and artist Michael Ryan, the lone character Whedon had mentioned he would add when he began his tenure of the book. When the time-displaced Runaways landed in 1907, they meet twelve year-old Klara, who had to live to serve her abusive middle-aged husband.Klara's ability is to control, or \"talk to\" (as she puts it), plants. Her name is a play on the word chloroplast, relating to her plant powers. When her family discovered her powers, they married her off to someone moving to America (even though she was still a child), where she ran into the Runaways in 1907, who later brought her back to the present with them. Klara is roughly Molly's age, has jet-black hair twisted in a braid, and gray eyes.",
