  "description": "Kirigi is a fictional ninja assassin in the Marvel Comics universe. After being resurrected by The Hand, he works as an operative for the group. He is extremely powerful; for example, he is capable of lifting at least 1000 pounds. Both a weapons master and an accomplished martial artist, his various areas of expertise include the use of the Katana, Shuriken, Kyoketsu shoge (rope knife), and sai. In addition, the use of a form of meditation allows him to recover from otherwise-mortal wounds. As a result, he is virtually impervious to all but devastating wounds.",
