  "description": "Angela is a fictional comic book character created by author Neil Gaiman and artist Todd McFarlane. She first appeared as a supporting antagonist in McFarlane's creator-owned series Spawn, making her debut in issue #9 in March 1993. She also starred in her own self-titled miniseries. Angela was later the subject of a legal battle between McFarlane and Gaiman over the rights to the character, which Gaiman won. She appears in books published by Marvel Comics, beginning with the 2013 Age of Ultron storyline, and her character was expanded upon in the 2014 event Original Sin, when she was established to be the lost sister of Thor.",
