  "description": "The Living Monolith (Ahmet Abdol) is a fictional character, a supervillain in the Marvel Comics Universe.  He first appeared in X-Men #54 (1969).Abdol was the Living Pharaoh while in his normal appearance, but once he obtained enough cosmic energy, he would increase in mass, size, and power, thus becoming the Living Monolith.Abdol has mainly been an X-Men villain, usually using Havok to become the Living Monolith. He has also used other superheroes, including the Fantastic Four (who gained their super powers from exposure to cosmic rays). He even killed his own daughter to achieve his goal.",
