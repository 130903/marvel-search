  "description": "The Mandarin is a fictional character, a supervillain who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the archenemy of Iron Man.The character was created by Stan Lee and designed by Don Heck, first appearing in Tales of Suspense #50 (February 1964). The character is described as being born in China before the Communist revolution, to a wealthy Chinese father and an English aristocratic mother, both of whom died when he was very young. He is characterised as a megalomaniac, attempting to conquer the world on several occasions, yet also possessing a strong sense of honor.The Mandarin is portrayed as a genius scientist and a superhumanly skilled martial artist. However, his primary sources of power are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and is worn on a specific finger.In other media, the Mandarin has been shown in several forms of animation and computer games. The character serves as the main villain of the 2013 film Iron Man 3. In 2009, Mandarin was ranked as IGN's 81st Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.",
