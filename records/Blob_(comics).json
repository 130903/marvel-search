  "description": "The Blob (Frederick J. Dukes) is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an adversary of the X-Men. A mutant originally depicted as an obese circus freak, the Blob claims to be immovable. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength. Possessing the mindset of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Freedom Force.He is one of the most prominent, long-running mutants to be depowered as a result of the Decimation storyline.The Blob appears in the 2009 superhero film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where he is played by actor Kevin Durand.",
