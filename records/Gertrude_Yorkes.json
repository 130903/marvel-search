  "description": "Gertrude Yorkes (self-referred to as Arsenic), is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Runaways. She was created by author Brian K. Vaughan & artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in Runaways vol. 1 #1 with most of the other main characters. Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil villains with special abilities; in Gert's case, time-travellers. Gertrude, often called \"Gert\" for short, is often regarded as the most \"book-smart\" of the Runaways yet also the most sarcastic and cynical. She has socialist leanings and is ethnically Jewish but spiritually agnostic. Gert is known for her sarcastic one-liners, a pair of glasses, and brown dyed purple hair. She stands at a rough height of 5'1\" and weighs 125 lb (57 kg).In 2008, Marvel.com named Gert's death as the sixth out of ten best deaths in Marvel Comics history.",
