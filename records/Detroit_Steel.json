Created by writer Matt Fraction and artist Salvador Larocca, Detroit Steel first appeared in Iron Man (vol 5) #25 (June 2010) as part of the \"Stark Resilient\" storyline. Detroit Steel is the first in a line of armored soldiers called the Detroit Steelcorps, or simply the Steelcorps, which is marketed by Stark's corporate rival, Hammer Industries. Principal characters in storylines that have worn the armor include Lt. Doug Johnson and Sasha Hammer. Individual soldiers wearing the Detroit Steel armor have been called Steelmechs or Hammermechs.",
