She first appeared in Wolverine/Gambit: Victims #1 (September 1995) as a 'dead' woman in an illusion, and in issue #2 as herself. She was created by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. Martinique is the daughter of Jason Wyngarde, the first Mastermind and member of the first Brotherhood of Mutants, and the half-sister of Regan Wyngarde, also known as Lady Mastermind and the X-Woman Megan Gwynn aka Pixie. Martinique has the ability of creating telepathic illusions, a power she shares with Regan and inherited from their father.",
