  "description": "Dead Girl (Moonbeam) is a fictional character, a  mutant superheroine in Marvel Comics' X-Statix series. She is a mixture of ghost and zombie. Her civilian name has never been fully revealed, but she admitted after some cajoling that her first name is/was \"Moonbeam.\" Dead Girl's mutant gene allows her to return to semi-life after dying; she is also able to become intangible and communicate with other dead people.",
