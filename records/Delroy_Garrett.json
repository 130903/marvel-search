  "description": "After being exposed as a steroid user and stripped of his awards, gifted sprinter Delroy Garrett Jr. sought new direction in the Triune Understanding, a philosophical movement that preaches the fulfillment of one's innate potential by balancing various aspects of environment and self, after which he developed a superhuman triple-powered physique, and, believing the Triune teachings had unlocked his latent powers, Garrett became the costumed hero Triathlon and celebrity spokesman for the Triune Understanding.",
