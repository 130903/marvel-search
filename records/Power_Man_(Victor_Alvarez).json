  "description": "A former street kid whoâ€™s not quite used to the Super Hero world, Luke is a no-nonsense tough guy who serves as the emotional heart and big brother of the group. He is fiercely loyal and nearly fearless in battle. \r\n\r\nLukeâ€™s unbreakable skin and super strength make him the bruiser out of all the trainees. Heâ€™s the first guy to jump into a fight. However, he can still be hurt by concussive blasts and other forms of energy.\r\n\r\nAs Dannyâ€™s best friend, Luke is the translator for Dannyâ€™s sometimes spacey, non-sequitur comments. Luke will always be the first to defend Peter from others, both as civilians and Super Heroes.",
