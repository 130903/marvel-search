Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Werner Roth, the character first appeared in X-Men #28 (January 1967).An Irish mutant, Banshee possesses a \"sonic scream,\" capable of harming enemiesâ€™ auditory systems and causing physical vibrations. He is named after the banshee, a legendary ghost from Irish mythology, said to possess a powerful cry.A former Interpol agent and NYPD police officer, Banshee was always a decade older than most of the X-Men and had only a relatively short tenure as a full-time X-Man. He was a mentor of the 1990s-era junior team Generation X. Caleb Landry Jones played the role of Banshee in 2011's X-Men: First Class.",
