  "description": "The Blazing Skull (Mark Anthony Todd) is a fictional superhero in the Marvel Comics universe, created during the 1930-'40s Golden Age of Comic Books for Marvel's predecessor, Timely Comics. He first appeared in Mystic Comics # 5 (March 1941), though his writer and artist creators are unknown. The Blazing Skull should not be confused with Marvel's unrelated supernatural motorcyclist the Ghost Rider, who is depicted with a flaming skull. Also, the unrelated Marvel character Skull the Slayer (James Scully) briefly used the alias \"Blazing Skull.\"",
