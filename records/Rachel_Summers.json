  "description": "Rachel Anne Summers (also known as Rachel Grey) is a fictional character, a comic book superheroine created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne for Marvel Comics.In her first appearance, the character's surname was not revealed; later publications and retcons further expanded her backstory to involve central characters of mainstream continuity. She is the daughter of the alternate future counterparts to Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Jean Grey-Summers from a harsh dystopia, the \"half\" sister of Cable, a niece of Havok and Vulcan, and a powerful mutant in her own right.Rachel Summers inherited her mother's vast telepathic and telekinetic talents. She also inherited her mother's original code names Phoenix and Marvel Girl. Although the character is considered unique to the Marvel Comics \"multiverse\", her name has been used to designate the mother of Marvel characters Hyperstorm and Dream Richards in respective timelines.",
