  "description": "Miss Steed (Emma Steed), also known as Black Queen is a fictional character created by Warren Ellis and Carlos Pacheco, a mutant in the Marvel Comics Universe. Her first appearance as Miss Steed was in Excalibur #96.  Emma Steed was an obvious homage to Emma Peel and John Steed, from the British television show The Avengers.  Early art for the character, in fact, matched the appearance of Diana Rigg who played Mrs. Emma Peel. Miss Steed initially appeared as Damask during the Age of Apocalypse, an event which caused the history of the Marvel Universe to diverge from its usual path. Although many Age of Apocalypse characters were alternate versions of existing heroes and villains, Damask did not appear to have an Earth-616 counterpart until Miss Steed was introduced over a year later.",
