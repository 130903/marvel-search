During the majority of the series, she is a member of the future version of X-Men led by Xi'an Chi Xan and later her lover Tim Fitzgerald (Skullfire). La Lunatica is a Hispanic mutant with the ability to feed on the memories of pain and suffering of her victims through tactile interaction, thereby increasing her own strength and durability. She has white skin and red eyes, reminiscent of albinism as well as elongated canine teeth. Her name is translated into Spanish as the feminine form of \"the lunatic\".",
