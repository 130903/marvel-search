  "description": "The Green Goblin is the alias of several supervillains that appear in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first and most high-profile incarnation is Norman Osborn, who was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in The Amazing Spider-Man #14 and is often considered the archenemy of Spider-Man. The Green Goblin is a Halloween-themed supervillain whose weapons resemble bats, ghosts and jack-o'-lanterns. Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character: \"Of all the costumed villains who've plagued Spider-Man over the years, the most flat-out unhinged and terrifying of them all is the Green Goblin.\" The Green Goblin has appeared in several films including 2002's Spider-Man as Norman Osborn, and 2014's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as Harry Osborn, Norman's embittered son.",
