  "description": "Southpaw (Sasha Martin) is a fictional character that first appeared in the Marvel comic She-Hulk. She is Holden Holliway's granddaughter and in the custody of She-Hulk (and if She-Hulk becomes Jennifer Walters, then Awesome Andy).She is incredibly powerful because of a gauntlet she wears that cannot be removed. She has a short temper and will often act without thinking (i.e., destroying her high school because they brought back school uniforms, or attacking the Champion because he took a piece of fruit from her).",
