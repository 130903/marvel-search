  "description": "Polaris (Lorna Dane) is a fictional comic book character and superhero appearing in books published by Marvel Comics, in particular the X-Men family of books. Created by Arnold Drake, Don Heck, Werner Roth and Jim Steranko, Polaris first appeared in The X-Men #49 (October, 1968). For most of her publication history, she has been a superheroine, and a member of either the X-Men or one of its sister groups, such as X-Factor, though from 1987 to 1989, she was possessed by a villainous telepathic entity, and functioned as the supervillain Malice.A mutant, Polaris can control magnetism, much like Magneto, whom she long suspected to be her biological father, a fact confirmed in Uncanny X-Men #431 (2003), making her also the half sister of the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. She has also had a complicated long term relationship with the X-Man Havok, to whom she was engaged.",
