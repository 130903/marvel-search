  "description": "The character is not to be confused with the Milestone and DC Comics villain Holocaust. He is also not to be confused with the historical Holocaust.Holocaust is a fictional character that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in X-Men Alpha (February 1995), and was created by Scott Lobdell and Roger Cruz; however, a character with the same name and similar appearance (without armor) was featured in \"Stryfe's Strike Files\" (January 1993), two years before X-Men Alpha was released (the information on Holocaust in Stryfe's Strike Files seems to support an understanding that both versions of the character are one and the same).",
