  "description": "M (Monet Yvette Clarisse Maria Therese St. Croix) is a fictional comic book superheroine, a mutant who appears in the X-Men family of books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Chris Bachalo, she originally was a member of the teenage mutant group Generation X (1994), and later X-Factor, and is now seen in X-Men.Additionally, Monet represents a rare example of a Muslim superhero in American superhero comic books; in 2011 X-Factor comics by Peter David, for example, this has been used to explore issues of anti-Muslim hate in contemporary American culture. Monet's faith adds Muslims to the list of minority groups that X-Men stories and characters are interpreted to allegorize.",
