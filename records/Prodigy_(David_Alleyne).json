  "description": "Prodigy (David Alleyne) is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in books published by Marvel Comics, in particular the X-Men family of books. Prodigy is a former mutant, one of the student body of the Xavier Institute, and a member of the New X-Men squad. He was created by writers Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir and artist Keron Grant, and he first appeared in New Mutants, vol. 2 #4 (October 2003).He was originally a mutant with the ability to absorb the knowledge and skills of anyone within a limited distance.  He could not control this ability and would forget his acquired knowledge once they became out of range.  He attends the Xavier Institute and becomes co-leader of the New Mutants training squad.  After the events of House of M and the ensuing \"Decimation\" of mutants, David loses his powers, but he remains at the Institute, becoming a member of the New X-Men team and utilizing his natural intellect to assist his teammates.  He later regains all the knowledge and skills he had absorbed before becoming depowered, including many of the X-Men's considerable expertise in science and physical combat, making him a stronger addition to the X-Men.  Despite being human, he remains with the X-Men as a substitute instructor and trainee for stories over a number of years.",
