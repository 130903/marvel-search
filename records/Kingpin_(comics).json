  "description": "The Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) is a fictional character, a supervillain in the Marvel Comics Universe. He is one of the most feared and powerful crime lords in the Marvel Universe. The character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #50. He is a recurring adversary of both Spider-Man and Daredevil, but has also clashed with the Punisher. Kingpin is also the husband of Vanessa Fisk and the father of Richard Fisk. IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked The Kingpin as #10.He is obese but heavily muscular at the same time, and is a terrifying hand-to-hand combatant.  He is also immensely wealthy and controls thousands of henchmen and underlings at any given time.  Finally, he is a genius-level criminal mind, capable of orchestrating international criminal rings.  His signature look is his white suit jacket and his walking stick, which he tips with diamonds or other hard substances as necessary to aid his physical combat.  The name 'Kingpin' is a reference to the title crime lord in mafia slang nomenclature.",
