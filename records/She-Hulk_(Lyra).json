  "description": "She-Hulk is the Hulk's action-loving cousin. She's unbelievably strong, pilots the group's heavily armed Jump Jet, and uses a pair of Gamma Gauntlets that give her fists an added energy wallop. As the most competitive member of the team, She-Hulk never backs down from a fight, arm-wrestling match, or burping contest!",
