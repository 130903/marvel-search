  "description": "Havok (Alexander \"Alex\" Summers) is a fictional character, a mutant superhero in the Marvel Comics Universe and member of the X-Men. He first appears in Uncanny X-Men No. 54 (March 1969), and was created by Arnold Drake, Don Heck, and Neal Adams. Havok generates powerful “plasma blasts”, an ability he has had difficulty controlling. He is the son of Corsair, the younger brother of the X-Men's Cyclops, and the older brother of Vulcan. He often resents Cyclops' authoritarian attitude and reputation as a model X-Man.In contrast, Havok and his longtime love interest Polaris have had a love/hate relationship with the team, often finding themselves roped into it. Both were also members of the 1990s-era Pentagon-sponsored mutant team X-Factor. After X-Factor disbanded, Havok starred in Mutant X, a series in which he explored a strange alternate reality. He has since returned to the X-Men, later taking over his father's role as leader of the Starjammers to bring Vulcan's reign over the Shi'ar to an end.Lucas Till played Havok, as a member of the X-Men, in 2011's superhero film X-Men: First Class. Till returned as Havok in the 2014 film, X-Men: Days of Future Past.",
