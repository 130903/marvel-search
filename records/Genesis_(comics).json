He first appeared in a flashback in X-Force #1 (1991). His first appearance as \"Mister Tolliver\" is in X-Force #5 (1992) and his first appearance as Genesis was in Cable volume 2 #19.In his first appearance, drawn by Rob Liefeld, Tyler has dark hair, but in all his later appearances, Tyler is blond.Some sources state that he is actually Cable's son.  Others state that he is Cable's 'nephew' since his father was Stryfe. Tyler's true biological parentage, however, has yet to be proven.",
