  "description": "Lilandra Neramani is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe. She is the Empress (or Majestrix) of the Shi'ar Empire and shares a lifelong bond with the leader of the X-Men, Charles Xavier. She and Xavier were married but their marriage was annulled after the Cassandra Nova incident. She first appeared in X-Men vol. 1 #97 (1976), making her the first Shi'ar to be introduced. As the Empress, Lilandra is protected by the Imperial Guard, led by Gladiator.Lilandra has often been a pivotal secondary character in the X-Men's history, from her participation in the Phoenix Saga, to her role in Grant Morrison's experimental and controversial run on New X-Men.  Her role as one of Professor X's most cherished loves has played a significant part in the development of both characters, as well as many of the plots throughout the X-Men books.",
