  "description": "Pixie (Megan Gwynn) is a fictional character, a mutant in the Marvel Universe.  Her mutation grants her pixie-like eyes, colorful wings that allow her to fly, and \"pixie dust\" which causes hallucinations.  After a confrontation with the revived former member of the New Mutants, Magik, she gains the ability to use magic and a magical weapon called the \"Souldagger.\"  Her main use of magic is a massive teleportation spell, which makes her a key asset to various X-Men missions and teams and places her as one of the titles' primary magic users.  She was first introduced as a student on the Paragons training squad at the Xavier Institute in New X-Men, vol. 2, later joining the New X-Men team, and later graduating to the Uncanny X-Men team.  Though only a side character in her initial appearances, she has since become a prominent character in various X-Men titles.",
